# Salary_prediction
For newly Graduated students it's really hard to find a source from which they can get a idea of their currrent worth in the IT industry.
Given the data, we can predict the salary of the job. Using this knowledge we can create many scenarios
like what will be the salary of the job or what should be the salary of the position (can be used by the
company), is my salary enough (the employee can think in this term).

# Measures used
## Clustering
Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points.Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering
algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group.In Data Science, we can use clustering analysis to gain some valuable insights
from our data by seeing what groups the data points fall into when we apply a clustering algorithm.

###### Methods used
1. K-means

## Distance Measures 
Choosing a good distance metric becomes really important here. The distance metric helps algorithms to recognize similarities between the
contents.Choosing a good distance metric will improve how well a classification or clustering algorithms performed.

###### Methods Used

1. Euclidean distance
2. Manhattan distance

## Regression 
Regression is a ML algorithm that can be trained to predict real numbered outputs; like temperature, stock price, etc. Regression is
based on a hypothesis that can be linear, quadratic, polynomial, non-linear, etc. The hypothesis is a function that based on some hidden
parameters and the input values. In the training phase, the hidden parameters are optimized w.r.t. the input values presented in the
training. The process that does the optimization is the gradient decent algorithm. If you are using neural networks, then you also need
Back-propagation algorithm to compute gradient at each layer. Once the hypothesis parameters got trained (when they gave least error
during the training), then the same hypothesis with the trained parameters are used with new input values to predict outcomes that will be
again real values.
